// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this 
// test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. 
// Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. 
// Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given 
// numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which 
// means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

// Examples:
// iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

// iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are o
