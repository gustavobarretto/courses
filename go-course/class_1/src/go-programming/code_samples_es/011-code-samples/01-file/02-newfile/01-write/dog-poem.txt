If you can sit quietly after difficult news, If in financial down-times you can remain perfectly calm, If you can love unconditionally and see your neighbours travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealously, If you can happily eat whatever is put on your plate, And if you can fall asleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill, If you can always find contentment wherever you are, You are probably a dog.
