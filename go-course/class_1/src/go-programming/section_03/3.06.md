10. When a variable is declared in Go using the `var` keyword, and no VALUE is ASSIGNED to that variable, then the compiler assigns a default value to the variable. This is known as the "zero value"

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

24. When you see something like `fmt.Println()` this is calling the `Println()` function from the `fmt` package.  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

25. An "identifier" is the name assigned to a variable or a function or a constant.  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

26. To call a func, variable, or constant from a package, use the "package-dot-identifier" syntax. For example, like this, `fmt.Println()`  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

27. What is "idiomatic Go code"?


28. Which character allows you to "throw away returns" or "send returns into the void"? Said another way, which character allows you to tell the compiler that you are not going to use a value returned by a function?  

  - [ ] #
  - [ ] @
  - [ ] _
  - [ ] This is a trick question

29. In Go, you cannot have a variable which you do not use.  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

30. When you see that a func has a parameter of this type `...interface{}` this is called a "variadic parameter" and it means that the func can take as many values of that type as you want to pass in.  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

31. Every value in Go is also of type "empty inerface" which is expressed like this: `interface{}`  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

32. A statement is an instruction that commands the computer to perform a specified action. Usually statements take up a line in a program. 

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

33. An expression is a combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, 2+3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

34. If I wanted to print to a string and then assign that value to a variable, I could use the `func Sprintf()` from the `fmt` package.

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

35. In Go, you can create your own TYPE

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

36. We don't say "casting" in Go, we say "conversion"  

  - [ ] true
  - [ ] false

37. There is a language which we use to talk about the language.

  - [ ] true
